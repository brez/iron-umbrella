### THE IDEA

Provides a diagonal (?) grid, etc for fft spectrum / color analysis which allows the music itself to create patterns.

### IMPORTANT

You can't run this from the directory it is NOT a traditional 'localhost' thing due to security restrictions on how the audio files load. You MUST set up a domain name in your /etc/hosts file and then point to that to make it work.

NOTE - the audio in the /audio has been removed in light of to copyright restrictions.
